# RepoBar Repo Wireframe

## Product Boundary

RepoBar Linux is a repository-pressure companion for SolverForge Linux. The product surface is a Waybar chip plus one QuickShell panel. The backend is Ruby, cache-backed, and daemon-owned.

No UI layer fetches hosted repository data directly. GitHub.com and Forgejo calls stay in `lib/repobar/core/github.rb`; local checkout inspection stays in `lib/repobar/core/local_git.rb`.

## High-Level Shape

1. `bin/repobar` starts the CLI.
2. `lib/repobar/cli.rb` parses commands and dispatches either read-only work or daemon-owned actions.
3. `lib/repobar/core/config.rb` normalizes config and settings.
4. `lib/repobar/core/cache.rb` stores REST responses, GraphQL responses, and rate-limit observations.
5. `lib/repobar/core/github.rb` fetches GitHub.com and Forgejo repository/account data.
6. `lib/repobar/core/local_git.rb` scans local checkouts and maps them to hosted repos.
7. `lib/repobar/runtime/daemon.rb` owns the action socket, refresh loop, refresh request coalescing, search jobs, and async effects.
8. `lib/repobar/runtime/store.rb` mutates runtime/config state for provider switches, visibility changes, search state, and projections.
9. `lib/repobar/runtime/state.rb` reads and writes cached JSON state.
10. `lib/repobar/runtime/presenter.rb` converts raw data into UI-ready `view` state.
11. `lib/repobar/runtime/waybar.rb` renders compact Waybar JSON from cached state.
12. `lib/repobar/runtime/quickshell.rb` opens, closes, toggles, and launches the QuickShell shell.
13. `frontend/quickshell/shell.qml` renders the human UI from watched JSON files.

## Runtime Files

All runtime files default to `~/.local/state/repobar/`.

- `snapshot.json`: canonical cached snapshot plus presenter `view`.
- `providers/github.json`: last cached GitHub snapshot.
- `providers/forgejo.json`: last cached Forgejo snapshot.
- `ui.json`: panel open state, focused repo, request timestamp.
- `search.json`: async search status, query, request id, selection, results, error, timestamp.
- `state-event.json`: stable watched reload signal for QuickShell.
- `daemon.lock`: daemon singleton lock.
- `daemon.sock`: daemon action socket.
- `refresh.lock`: refresh serialization lock.
- `cache/rest.json`: REST cache keyed by request URI.
- `cache/graphql.json`: GraphQL cache keyed by query and variables.
- `cache/rate_limits.json`: observed rate-limit state.

## Refresh Flow

1. `repobar daemon`, `repobar daemon --once`, or `repobar refresh` loads config.
2. `Runtime::State.with_refresh_lock` serializes refresh work.
3. `Core::GitHub.auth_status` checks GitHub auth or Forgejo public/private access.
4. If authenticated and `settings.showContributionHeader` is enabled, `Core::GitHub.account_heatmap` fetches the account activity calendar.
5. `Core::GitHub.fetch_repositories` loads pinned/visible repositories or recent user repositories, filters hidden/fork/archive rows, sorts them, and hydrates selected rows.
6. Hydration adds open issue/PR counts, issue/PR preview items, latest release, CI status, recent activity, traffic where available, and per-repo activity heatmap.
7. `Core::LocalGit.scan` scans configured roots and `Core::LocalGit.match_repositories` attaches local branch/dirty/ahead/behind state.
8. `Runtime::Presenter.build_snapshot_view` creates summary, chip, account heatmap, repo views, and local repo views.
9. If the provider/config identity still matches the refresh start identity, `Runtime::State.write_snapshot` writes `snapshot.json`, writes the active provider snapshot, and updates `state-event.json`.
10. If the user switched provider or changed the refresh identity while the refresh was running, the completed refresh writes only the original provider snapshot under `providers/` and does not replace active UI state.
11. `Runtime::Store.signal_waybar` sends the configured RTMIN signal to Waybar.

## Action Flow

1. CLI commands and QuickShell call `Runtime::Daemon.dispatch_action`.
2. `Runtime::Daemon.ensure_running` starts `repobar daemon` if no action socket is ready.
3. The daemon handles actions on `daemon.sock` and returns JSON results.
4. Actions that change provider or repo visibility request a daemon refresh.
5. Refresh requests are coalesced: while one refresh is running, additional requests mark one pending follow-up instead of spawning unbounded refresh threads.

Daemon-owned actions:

- `open_panel`
- `close_panel`
- `set_provider`
- `pin`
- `unpin`
- `hide`
- `show`
- `search_start`
- `search_select`
- `ping`

## Provider Flow

1. `repobar provider github|forgejo` dispatches `set_provider`.
2. The current snapshot is saved under the current provider cache path.
3. Config is rewritten with provider host, API host, and auth source.
4. `search.json` is reset.
5. If the target provider has a cached provider snapshot, that snapshot is projected immediately.
6. If not, a blank provider projection is written while a coalesced async refresh is requested.
7. Refreshes that started before the switch cannot overwrite the newly active provider view; they can only update the provider snapshot for the identity they started with.

## Search Flow

1. QuickShell text input calls `repobar search <query> --limit 8`.
2. The daemon writes `search.json` as `loading` with a request id.
3. A search thread calls `Core::GitHub.search_repositories`.
4. The daemon writes `search.json` as `ready` or `error`.
5. QuickShell renders up to six results.
6. Search results can be selected, opened, or pinned.
7. Pinning a search result inserts a pending projected repo into `snapshot.json`; the next refresh hydrates it.

## QuickShell Layout

Panel:

1. Header with title, active account, repository/work counts, provider switch buttons, refresh, and close.
2. Optional account activity heatmap with summary stats.
3. Search input and result list.
4. Optional issue/PR reader panel for the selected repository.
5. Scrollable repository card list.

Repo cards:

1. Status rail.
2. Owner avatar or fallback initial.
3. Repository name, description, CI/PR/issue/star/update line, local checkout line, release/activity line.
4. Activity heatmap text plus clipped heatmap track.
5. Icon action strip: open, read, refresh, pin/unpin, hide.

Search results:

1. Owner avatar or fallback initial.
2. Repository name, description, stars.
3. Icon actions: open and pin/already-pinned.

Reader panel:

1. Selected repo title and work count.
2. Up to three cached PR previews.
3. Up to three cached issue previews.
4. Open buttons for preview URLs.

## Waybar Flow

1. Waybar calls `repobar waybar render`.
2. `Runtime::Waybar.payload` reads the cached snapshot only.
3. If no snapshot exists, Waybar renders a loading chip.
4. If a snapshot exists, presenter chip text and classes become the Waybar JSON payload.
5. Middle click should route to `repobar waybar refresh`; left/right click should route to `repobar waybar panel` or equivalent wrapper.
